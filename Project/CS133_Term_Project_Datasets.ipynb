        "1. Each project team will choose one of the following data sets for their project. Create a Google Colab notebook to perform the data analysis and visualization for this project. Create and answer at least 5 unique questions using different types of plots to help you understand the data. One of the plots must be a map visualization. Besides the map, one of the plots must be an interactive plot. You can create additional categorical columns or reshape your data to help you understand the data.\n",

        "2. Each data set has a prediction goal. Create a test set and a training set using the original data set.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Follow the steps that we use in Lecture and Hands-ons 15 and 16 to prepare the data and pipeline for training a few ML classification or regression models that can perform the prediction as indicated in the data set description. Use any strategy that you see fit. Use N-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of each model.\n",

Life evaluations from the Gallup World Poll provide the basis for the annual happiness rankings that have always sparked widespread interest. We can learn what factors contribute to the secrets of life in the happiest countries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the descriptions of the data:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `Country_name` - Name of the country\n",
        "- `year` - This dataset contains survey data of the state of global happiness from 2005 to 2021.\n",
        "- `Life_Ladder` - Also know as, Cantril ladder. Respondents are asked to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst possible life being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale.\n",
        "- `Log_GDP_per_capita` - is in terms of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) adjusted to constant 2011 international dollars, taken from the World Development Indicators (WDI) released by the World Bank on November 14, 2018. The equation uses the natural log of GDP per capita, as this form fits the data significantly better than GDP per capita.\n",
        "- `Social_support` - is the national average of the binary responses (either 0 or 1) to the Gallup World Poll (GWP) question “If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?”\n",
        "- `Healthy_life_expectancy_at_birth` - are constructed based on data from the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Observatory data repository, with data available for 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2016. To match this report’s sample period, interpolation and extrapolation are used.\n",
        "- `Freedom_to_make_life_choices` - is the national average of binary responses to the GWP question “Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?”\n",
        "- `Generosity` - is the residual of regressing the national average of GWP responses to the question “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?” on GDP per capita.\n",
        "- `Perceptions_of_corruption` - are the average of binary answers to two GWP questions: “Is corruption widespread throughout the government or not?” and “Is corruption widespread within businesses or not?” Where data for government corruption are missing, the perception of business corruption is used as the overall corruption-perception measure.\n",
        "- `Positive_affect` - is defined as the average of previous-day affect measures for happiness, laughter, and enjoyment for GWP waves 3-7 (years 2008 to 2012, and some in 2013). It is defined as the average of laughter and enjoyment for other waves where the happiness question was not asked. The general form for the affect questions is: Did you experience the following feelings during a lot of the day yesterday?\n",
        "- `Negative_affect` - is defined as the average of previous-day affect measures for worry, sadness, and anger for all waves.\n",
        "- `Confidence_in_national_government` - level of trust in government\n",

        "Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopment condition associated with significant healthcare costs, and early diagnosis can significantly reduce these. Unfortunately, waiting times for an ASD diagnosis are lengthy and procedures are not cost effective. The economic impact of autism and the increase in the number of ASD cases across the world reveals an urgent need for the development of easily implemented and effective screening methods. Therefore, a time-efficient and accessible ASD screening is imminent to help health professionals and inform individuals whether they should pursue formal clinical diagnosis. The rapid growth in the number of ASD cases worldwide necessitates datasets related to behaviour traits. However, such datasets are rare making it difficult to perform thorough analyses to improve the efficiency, sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of the ASD screening process. Presently, very limited autism datasets associated with clinical or screening are available and most of them are genetic in nature. In this dataset, there are ten behavioural features ([AQ-10-Child])(https://autismhampshire.org.uk/assets/uploads/AQ10-Child.pdf) plus ten individuals characteristics that have proved to be effective in detecting the ASD cases from controls in behaviour science.\n",

Exposure over short periods can aggravate respiratory diseases, like asthma. Longer exposures may contribute to develoment of asthma and respiratory infections. People with asthma, children and the elderly are at greater risk for the health effects of NO2.\n",

        "Ozone [O3] : The Ozone molecule is harmful for outdoor air quality. It is created by chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds (VOC). Differently from the good ozone located in the upper atmosphere, ground level ozone can provoke several health problems like chest pain, coughing, throat irritation and airway inflammation. Furthermore it can reduce lung function and worsen bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma. Ozone affects also vegetation and ecosystems. In particular, it damages sensitive vegetation during the growing season.\n",
        "\n",
        "Carbon Monoxide [CO] : Carbon Monoxide is a colorless and odorless gas. Outdoor, it is emitted in the air above all by cars, trucks and other vehicles or machineries that burn fossil fuels. Such items like kerosene and gas space heaters, gas stoves also release CO affecting indoor air quality. Breathing air with a high concentration of CO reduces the amount of oxygen that can be transported in the blood stream to critical organs like the heart and brain. At very high levels, which are not likely to occur outdoor but which are possible in enclosed environments. CO can cause dizziness, confusion, unconsciousness and death.\n",

        "Particulate Matter [PM2.5] : Atmospheric Particulate Matter, also known as atmospheric aerosol particles, are complex mixtures of small solid and liquid matter that get into the air. If inhaled they can cause serious heart and lungs problem. They have been classified as group 1 carcinogen by the International Agengy for Research on Cancer (IARC). PM10 refers to those particules with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less. PM2.5 refers to those particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less.\n",
